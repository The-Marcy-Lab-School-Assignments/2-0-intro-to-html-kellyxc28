# Question

What does it mean when a tag is a "child" of a "parent?".

# Answer

When a tag is a "child" of a "parent", this means a tag is placed hierarchically under a parent tag. I think this means it would inherit the attributes the parent has.

So close! A child tag is one that is nested within a parent tag, like so: 

```html

<ul>
  <li> This is a child tag </li>
  <li> This is another child tag </li>
  <li> Child tags are nested and in this case, the parent is the ul. </li>
</ul>

```
