# Question

What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer

"Semantic" elements are utilized to make pages more accessible. They do this by providing the screen readers and browsers information about what is being presented. This is an additional reason why the order of the elements matter.

# Teacher Feedback

Yes! Also non-semantic tags will be used for grouping and semantic tags will describe the type of content within!
