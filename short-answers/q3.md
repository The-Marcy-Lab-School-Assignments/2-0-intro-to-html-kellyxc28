# Question

Where do html attributes go?

# Answer

The HTML attributes go in the opening tags, which are tags without the slash (`/`) in them. This can be seen in the following example: `<img src="https://http.cat/images/200.jpg" alt="A weird looking cat that exudes good vibes.">` In this case, the attributes are `src` and `alt`.
